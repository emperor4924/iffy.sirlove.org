<h2><u>MY ACHIEVEMENT</u></h2>

<br>Achievement can be refers to as a great heroic deed;something accomplished by valor, boldness, or praiseworthy. Achievement is also the act of achieving or performing;an obtaining by exertion; successful performance.</br>
<br>An achievement can be made possible only if you are deermined,focus and have a dream. Every achievement comes as a result of great service. My first achievement in life started from my Primary School days when I hope of becoming a proffesor in mathematics My Primary School days was absorbing and energetic. I started growing gradually and I wrote the Common Entrance Examination and passed.</br>
<br>I was given admission into George Green Baptist College which was a Day and Boarding School but i choose to be a day student. i faced a lot challenges due to my grammatical blunders and because of this my friend use to critize me but at the end it was for my good. when it was time for our JSS 3 exam i was afraid but i came out with the best result of my school which was to the surprise of my teachers.I continue in my school as a commercial student before i change to science class due to lack of competition in commercial class. It was not easy but i prevail over every challenges.
<p>After my secondar school i proceed to ladoke akintola unversity of technology for pre-dregree program. i passed but unfortunately i was not given the course i want.This lead me to kwara state university JUPEB program. i did jupeb and i came out  in flying color. I choose mathematics before kwasu gave me computer science which i later found interesting.
